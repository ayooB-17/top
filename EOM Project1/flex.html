          think differently It’s been shown that learning to code can help you
          do better in other subjects that you’re studying or learning. Within
          programming, you learn how to break down a problem into individual
          steps and to use a language that the computer understands to logically
          create a working program. In doing so, you develop a certain mindset
          on approaching problems and processing large amounts of information
          that is necessary with conquering any new topic. In other words, you
          learn to look at problems from a bigger picture and adapt to working
          through the frustrations of hitting brick walls to solve issues. It’s
          been said that it’s important to learn how to think first, before
          actually learning the what. Learning to code is more than just
          learning a computer language – it’s about creating an effective and
          productive mindset towards problem-solving that will positively affect
          any new intellectual endeavor you take on.
