          </h1><br /><br /><br />

          <p>Learning to code has grown over the years from just a hobby to a career. Today, you can learn coding online, entirely for free. Gone are the days where knowing a programming language was reserved for the select few, or cost quite a hefty amount of money.</p><br />

          <p>Even if you have no desire to go into the development field, learning a programming language can be very beneficial:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>It’ll help you better manage websites</li>
            <li>It’ll reduce reliance on an outside developer for your own projects</li>
